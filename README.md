### 🌟 How to Play Texas Hold'em Poker 🌟

Texas Hold'em is one of the most popular poker games. The goal is simple: make the best possible **five-card poker hand** using a combination of your two private cards (**hole cards**) and the five **community cards** shared by everyone. 💰

Here's the flow of a typical hand:

1.  **Blinds** 🎰
    * A "dealer button" 🔘 rotates clockwise each hand to indicate who the nominal dealer is.
    * The player to the left of the button posts the "Small Blind" (a small forced bet).
    * The player to the left of the Small Blind posts the "Big Blind" (typically double the Small Blind). These ensure there's money in the pot to start.

2.  **The Deal (Pre-Flop)** 🃏🃏
    * Starting with the player to the left of the Big Blind, each player is dealt two cards face down. These are your **hole cards**, only for you to see! 👀
    * The first betting round begins, starting with the player to the left of the Big Blind.
    * Players can choose to:
        * **Fold** ✋: Give up their hand and wait for the next one.
        * **Call** 💰: Match the amount of the Big Blind (or the last raise).
        * **Raise** ⬆️: Increase the bet amount.

3.  **The Flop** 
    * Deals three **community cards** face up in the middle of the table (the **flop**). These are shared by all remaining players.
    * A second betting round occurs, starting with the first active player to the left of the dealer. Players can Check (if no bet is before them), Bet, Call, Raise, or Fold. 

4.  **The Turn** 
    * Deals a fourth community card face up.
    * A third betting round takes place, following the same rules as the flop betting round. 

5.  **The River** 
    * Deals the fifth and final community card face up (the **river** card).
    * The fourth and final betting round occurs.

6.  **The Showdown** 🎉🏆
    * If two or more players remain after the final betting round, it's time for the **Showdown**!
    * Players reveal their two hole cards.
    * Each player uses the best combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to make the highest-ranking five-card poker hand.
    * The player with the best five-card hand wins the entire pot! If hands are tied, the pot is split.
